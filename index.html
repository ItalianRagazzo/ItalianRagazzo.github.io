            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                Hello! I'm a dedicated computer programmer with a strong background in VB.NET and WPF development, coupled with proficiency in C++. Currently, I'm on a rewarding academic journey pursuing a degree in Computer Science and Mathematics at Penn State Behrend.<br /><br />
                My programming experience extends to crafting robust applications in VB.NET and leveraging the versatility of WPF for intuitive user interfaces. In addition, I possess a solid foundation in C++, contributing to my repertoire of skills in software development.<br /><br />
                Beyond my academic pursuits, I am deeply fascinated by puzzle-solving algorithms and the transformative world of machine learning. These interests fuel my curiosity and drive me to explore innovative solutions in the dynamic field of computer science.<br /><br />
                I'm passionate about pushing the boundaries of what technology can achieve and look forward to contributing my skills and knowledge to impactful projects in the future.<br /><br />
            </p>

            <h2>Experience</h2>
            <h3>Developer - KMD Technology Solutions, LLC | Nov 2019 - Present</h3>
            <p>
                I developed a system administrator tool using VB.NET, XAML, and HTML. This tool simplifies the creation of complex emails by providing a user-friendly interface for input. Additionally, I streamlined the deliverable creation process to enhance efficiency in task entry.<br /><br />
                In terms of user interaction, I implemented the MVVM method to create an informative page. This page informs users about activities that occurred since their last login, providing valuable insights into system events.<br /><br />
                As part of system maintenance, I conducted standard bug testing and repairs to fix broken features. Moreover, I refreshed older features, giving them a more modern and visually appealing style.<br /><br />
                To enhance data accessibility, I developed multiple REST endpoints using ASP.NET Web API. These endpoints were seamlessly integrated to securely access data stored in a Microsoft Azure-hosted database. To facilitate collaboration with an outsourced development team, I supplied comprehensive comments and documentation via Swagger UI.<br /><br />
                For process automation, I configured scheduled tasks using Azure webjobs. This setup ensured the smooth execution of automated processes, contributing to the overall efficiency of the system.<br /><br />
